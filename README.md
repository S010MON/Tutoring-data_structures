## Building and Running
In an IDE you should be able to run the tests by navigating to `Tutoring-data_structures/app/src/test/java/dataStructures` and running the tests for each type of ADT. 

If you are not using an IDE you can run gradle in the terminal by navigating to the `Tutoring-data_structures/` directory (you should see a file named gradlew).  Then run:
```bash
gradle build
```
This will run all of the tests, you may see FAILED notifications, this is fine, the tests are failing as you have to add your code!
