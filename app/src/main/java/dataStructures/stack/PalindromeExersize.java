    This class provides an exersize in which you are required to use the MyStackImp class you created.
    Your task is to implement the isPalindrome() method, which is capable of determining if a provided string
    is a Palindrome using a Stack. Returns True if the word/ phrase is a palindrome and False otherwise.

    You should take into account that not all letters are lowercase, and that the phrase or sentence may contain
    punctuation.

    A palindrome is a word or phrase that is read the same forwards and backwards:
    Take for example the word `racecar`. This is identical both forwards and backwards.
